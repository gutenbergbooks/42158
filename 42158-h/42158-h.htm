<h1>"HOME IN SIGHT."</h1>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OME on deck, all hands, old and young, great and
small, sick and well! Here is a sight that will
do you good."</div>

<p>So said the bluff old captain to his passengers.
Up they came, one after another, at the summons. The
lady who was so worn down with sea-sickness sat with her
head resting languidly on her husband's shoulder. The rest
stood in groups, looking out upon the water.</p>

<p>The voyage had been a long one, and, though they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
not all sea-sick, all were heartily sick of the sea,&mdash;all except
two little children, a girl and a boy, whose faces were
always bright and merry.</p>

<p>"What is there to be seen, captain?" said the children's
mother, after trying in vain to make out any thing except
sea and sky.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" said the old man. "Let me point
it out then to this little sailor."</p>

<p>So, taking little Willie in his arms while the vessel
leaned before the breeze, he pointed with his forefinger, and
said, "Do you see that dark-blue cloud right on the edge of
the water, just where it meets the sky?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see it," said the bright-eyed youngster.</p>

<p>"Well, do you know what it is, my lad? It isn't a cloud
at all. That's land. Now do you know what land it is?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Willie.</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. It is old Cape Cod.&mdash;We are in
sight of home, ladies and gentlemen," said the captain addressing
his passengers. "We shall make Boston Light to-night,
if this wind holds good."</p>

<p>This speech brought great applause. Then the captain
sang out,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Cheer up, my lively lads, spite of wind and weather!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cheer up, my lively lads, and we'll go home together!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Hold me up," said little Ellen, "and let me see."</p>

<p>Then the captain held her up too; and when the children's
mother, who had a fine voice, started the song,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Home again, home again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From a foreign shore,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>all the passengers, not even excepting the sick lady, took
part in the chorus.</div>

waked up early; but nurse was not ready to dress her.</div>

<p>She was just going to cry, when the kitten jumped
up on the bed, and stood there with such a comical
look, that, instead of crying, Nellie could not help
laughing.</p>

<p>Then she got a string and began to play with kitty; so
that when the nurse came in she found them both quite
happy.</p>

<p>One day, Nellie was playing with her doll, and put it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in her lap. Kitty, who had been watching her all the time,
jumped up in Nellie's lap, pushed the doll out, and lay down,
looking at her mistress, as if to say,&mdash;</p>

has any right here."</p>

put in a cage, from which he cannot escape to do
any more mischief. The fowls all come from the
barnyard to see him. They dare go near him now,
for they know he cannot harm them.</div>

<p>The sparrow looks saucily at him, saying, "Ah, ha, Sir
Hawk! You have scared me many a time with your sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
claws and hooked beak; but now I am a match for you. It
was fine fun for you to kill little chickens. Now you see
what comes of it."</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," cries the turkey, "he killed seven dear
little chickens. How glad I am that he is caught at last!
I'll give him a piece of my mind now, but he can't have
any more chickens."</p>

<p>"Ah!" says the hawk, "you talk very bravely; but, if I
were let out of this cage, you would not stare at me much
longer."</p>

<p>The fowls walk slowly away without saying more. But
the pert young sparrow bristles up, and dares the hawk to
come out and fight him. It is very easy to be brave when
there is no danger.</p>

<h2>CONTENTMENT.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">When</span> the roses bloom sweet and red,<br />
And the daisy has lifted her shining head;<br />
When birds are still in the brooding nest,&mdash;<br />
Of all the seasons summer is best.<br />
<br />
When the golden-rod's torches shine,&mdash;<br />
And the purple grapes drop ripe from the vine;<br />
When the reddening maples light up the way,<br />
There is nothing so good as an autumn day.<br />
<br />
When the hills are white with snow,<br />
And only the frostflowers dare to blow;<br />
When sleigh-bells chime from far and near,&mdash;<br />
Winter's the best time of all the year.<br />
<br />
When the wild brooks begin to leap,<br />
And out of the earth the mosses creep;<br />
When swallows twitter, and robins call,&mdash;<br />
Spring is the very best time of all.<br />

<h2>BLUEBERRYING.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">The</span> grass is scorching in the sun;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis summer's hottest weather;</span><br />
But Dick and Tom start bravely forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For blueberries together.</span><br />
Their tin pails glitter in the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dippers in them rattle,</span><br />
As up the long green lane they go,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the browsing cattle.</span><br />
<br />
Close underneath the pasture fence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They find some scattered bushes:</span><br />
"There is some better place beyond,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dick, and on he pushes,</span><br />
Through tangled brake, o'er stumbling stones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up some steep black ledges,</span><br />
Where thick the blueberry-bushes grow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the rocky edges.</span><br />
<br />
"But these are very dry and small,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Tommy: "I would rather</span><br />
Look round and find some better place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And larger berries gather."</span><br />
Down the sharp rocks, across the brook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through a bog, they ramble:</span><br />
They find some berries, big and blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outpeering from a bramble.</span><br />
<br />
"These dreadful running blackberry-vines!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dick: "they are so prickly!</span><br />
I will not stop; some better place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We surely shall find quickly."</span><br />
Through the long field they wandering stray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hot sunshine going:</span><br />
"Beneath the wood-lot trees," says Tom,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"There must be nice ones growing."</span><br />
<br />
And so they find them thick and ripe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, from among them darting,</span><br />
A hissing adder lifts its head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, suddenly upstarting,</span><br />
The frightened boys drop both their pails,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The berries from them spilling.</span><br />
"Let's hurry home," says Tom. Says Dick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm sure that I am willing."</span><br />
<br />
So back they come with tattered clothes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scratched, sunburnt, soiled, and tired;</span><br />
"To go again," says pouting Tom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I never could be hired."</span><br />
"Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!" cries Dick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A doleful little fretter,</span><br />
"We've lost each good place we have had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By looking for a better!"</span><br />

<h2>THE WOUNDED LAMB.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 55px;">
<img src="images/drop_e.png" width="55" height="135" alt="E" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ARLY one bright morning, three little girls who were
spending the summer on their uncle's farm went out
to gather wild flowers in the woods not far from the
house. Just as they came to the edge of the wood,
they heard the faint bleating of a lamb.</div>

<p>They listened, keeping very still, but could not make out
where the sound came from. Then Mary, the eldest of the
three, said, "Let us each go a different way, and hunt till
we find the poor little thing."</p>

<p>They did so; and in a few minutes, Lulu the youngest
called to the others, "I've found it! I've found it! Come,
Mollie and Bessie, come quick and help me; for the dear
little lamb is hurt, and I'm afraid it will die."</p>

<p>You may be sure that they all ran quickly, and it was
well that they did; for the lamb had broken its leg, and
could not have lived much longer if some one had not
taken care of it. They found Lulu trying to help the poor
creature; but she could do little except to soothe it.</p>

<p>Just then Bessie looked up, and saw the farmer not far
off. She called loudly to him. He came at once, took the
lamb tenderly in his arms, carried it home, laid it on a soft
bed, and gave it some warm milk.</p>

<p>Very soon the lamb began to revive, much to the delight
of the children; and little Lulu would hardly leave its side
all that day.</p>

<p>With such kind care the lamb got well fast. It soon
became a great pet with all the little girls, though their
uncle said, that, as Lulu had found it, she should give it a
name, and call it hers.</p>

<p>For some time she was quite puzzled to know what to call
it; but one day, when Bessie was stroking it, she said,
"Why lambie, your fleece is as fine and soft as floss!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/illus269.jpg" width="448" height="600" alt="Three girls and a fawn" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, now I know what to call this pet," said Lulu, "I'll
call it Flossy," and it went by that name all summer.</p>

<p>The next winter, when their uncle came to see them in
the city, the children inquired for their little pet, Flossy.</p>

<p>"Flossy is a big sheep now," he said; "but I think she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
remembers you, for when I go among the flock, she always
comes and rubs her nose against me, and looks up, as much
as to say, 'Where are those three girls that used to play
with me last summer?'"</p>

<h2>LISA.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 52px;">
<img src="images/drop_l.png" width="52" height="135" alt="L" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ISA was a little German girl who lived in a village
on the seacoast. Her father was a fisherman, and
sometimes he would take her with him on pleasant
days when he went in his boat.</div>

<p>They would start in the morning, and after sailing
about, and catching a good load of fish, would come home at
noon to the nice dinner which Lisa's elder sister had prepared
for them.</p>

<p>One day Lisa was alone in the house. Her sister had
gone away to spend the day, and her father was out fishing.
A heavy storm came up. It rocked the house, and blew the
shutters to and fro; but Lisa never heeded it, for she was
thinking of her father.</p>

<p>After the storm had ceased, she went to the door and
looked out. An old fisherman was passing with his son.
She asked him about her father. He pointed out the place
where he had seen him before the storm, and said, "I fear
that your father's boat has been driven upon the rocks, for
it is no longer to be seen."</p>

<p>Without a moment's delay, Lisa tied on her hat, and
hastened down to the shore. She got into a boat, and was
pushing off, when an old sailor stopped her, and asked her
where she was going.</p>

<p>"I am going in search of my father," said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go with you, my good girl," said the sailor; and
he sprang into the boat, and took the oars.</p>

<p>They rowed out to the rocks, for the sea had gone down.
Poor Lisa's heart sank within her as she gazed upon that
angry coast; for the first thing that caught her eyes was a
fragment of a boat.</p>

<p>Yes, her father's boat had surely been wrecked. "Oh,
my dear, dear father!" said Lisa, bursting into tears, "I
shall never see him again."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus271.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt="Girl running out door to greet father" />
</div>

<p>But hark! There comes a shout, "Boat ahoy!" Lisa's
heart beats wildly, for it is her father's voice. Quick as
thought, the sailor pulls to the place where the sound came
from. And there Lisa found her father clinging to a rock.
What a joyful meeting there was! And how happy Lisa
felt to think that she had gone so promptly to the rescue!</p>

<p>There were thankful hearts in the fisherman's cottage
that night; and Lisa never forgot the good old sailor who
had proved such a true friend in time of need.</p>

<h2>THE PET FAWN.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="62" height="150" alt="O" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />NE day, Albert, who lived in a city, received a letter
from his papa, who was absent in the country, which
I think my little readers will enjoy also, and so I
have got Albert's permission to give it to them.
This is the letter:&mdash;</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p><i>My dear little Boy</i>,&mdash;In a lonely place, just at the edge of a wood,
where I was detained, week before last, I came across a most delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
little pet. You could not guess in twenty guesses what it was, and so I
will tell you at once.</p>

<p>It was a fawn about eight months old. I am sure if you could have
seen him you would never have given papa a moment's rest till you had
him as your own pet; and perhaps I shall have something to say to you
about that by and by.</p>

<p>Well, this charming little pet was of a light yellowish-brown color,
and over his whole body were white spots about the size of a dime.</p>

<p>Some boys had surprised him asleep, when he was about a week
old, and had carefully taken him home with them. There he had been
tended and made much of by the whole family, and so he had grown to
have a genuine affection for his captors.</p>

<p>He was allowed full freedom to go about the woods as he chose, and
never failed to return at night; and when called by name&mdash;for the boys
had named him Dick&mdash;he would come bounding up as if he dearly loved
to be petted.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see him eat milk. When the saucer was set before
him and he commenced to lap the milk, he would beat a tattoo with one
of his front feet. He never lapped his saucer of milk without, in this
manner, beating the floor with his hoof.</p>

<p>Now, my little boy, I do wish that these boys might be induced to
sell this fawn. If I could get him, don't you think a little boy that I
could name would have a beautiful pet? But we will not expect too
much, will we?</p>

<div class='sig'>
Your loving <span class="smcap">Papa</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>I want to tell my little readers that Albert has a fawn
which he calls his own and pets and caresses. It has a blue
ribbon around its neck with a little bell attached, and we all
laugh to see it beat a tattoo with its little foot while it laps
milk from a saucer. Albert says, "It's ten times more
beautiful, and a hundred times dearer than papa wrote
about."</p>

mother in Nice. This is a charming place in the
south of France, on the shore of the Mediterranean
Sea, and their home there was in a pretty villa.</div>

<p>One morning, as Helen was watering and trimming
her plants at the open window,&mdash;for the air is warm and
pleasant in Nice, even in winter,&mdash;she heard a soft voice
calling just underneath, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle, achetez mes fleurs,
s'il vous plait?</i>" In English this means, "Please buy my
flowers, miss?"</p>

<p>Helen looked down, and there stood a little barefooted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
dark-eyed girl, a good deal smaller than herself, holding up
a bunch of roses and violets. Her face was so sweet and
smiling, that Helen could not refuse her: so she said in
French, "How much are they, little girl?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dix centimes seulement</i>" ("only two cents"), she replied.</p>

<p>"Come round to the door, and I will buy them," said
Helen.</p>

<p>The girl ran quickly to the door. When Helen learned
from her that her mother was very poor, she gave her more
than the price of her flowers; and the little girl's face fairly
beamed with delight when she went away.</p>

<span class="smcap">Little</span> Tommy Tompkins sitting on a log<br />
Holds a conversation with a consequential frog.<br />

"I had my new green coat on: you nearly ruined that!<br />
Little Tommy Tompkins, I believe in 'tit for tat.'"<br />

"Dry your tears, and stop your noise, and from that log arise.<br />

"The sport of being stoned you shall have a chance to see;<br />
I hope it will be fun for you; 'twill be jolly fun for me."<br />

Down to the muddy water, while froggie makes a dash,<br />
<br />
And, sitting on the log, oh many a stone throws he,<br />
Hitting wretched little Tommy with considerable glee.<br />
<br />
"Hold on!" cries Tommy, vainly. "You're nothing but a frog!"<br />
Comes the answer, as the stones fly faster from the log.<br />
<br />
Was ever boy so wretched! was ever frog so glad!<br />
I really don't know what would have happened to the lad.<br />

But by chance a wandering bee stung young Tommy on the nose,<br />

<h2>LONELY JACK.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="82" height="150" alt="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HO do you suppose Jack was? Not a boy, nor a
dog, nor a horse, nor a parrot. He was a fat little
donkey, who lived on a large farm with thirteen
other donkeys, all fat too, and they had nothing
to do all day long but eat and be happy.</div>

<p>Jack thought there never before had been such fortunate
creatures as they were, and did not dream of separation
from his dear friends. But one day a man came up with a
rope, and, before the donkeys knew what he was doing,
threw it over poor little Jack's neck, and tried to lead him
away.</p>

<p>But Jack hadn't the least intention of going. Oh, dear,
no! He planted his feet firmly on the ground, while the
man pulled, and pulled, and pulled, but could not make
him stir a step. At last the man gave up and went away;
but he came back the next day with two more men.</p>

<p>Then, spite of Jack's firmness, his legs were bound, and
he was laid in a wagon, and carried miles and miles away
from all his dear companions.</p>

<p>His new home was a small farm where there were no
friends for him at all. Jack soon grew so lonely, that he
even felt anxious to scrape acquaintance with the hens and
chickens. But they all rushed wildly away as soon he approached;
and one old hen cackled out, "Good gracious, my
children, my children! do keep out of the way of that ugly
beast."</p>

<p>Jack was so grieved that he did not dare to make any
more attempts at sociability that day; and, indeed there
was no one else he could speak to, except Growler, the big
bull-dog.</p>

<p>"A fine day, sir," said Jack, carelessly sauntering by the
kennel.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bow-wow-wow!" barked Growler, making a frantic rush
for Jack's legs.</p>

<p>Now donkeys don't often run; but Jack ran then as fast
as he could go, straight across to the other end of the field,
and right into a lot of the most delicious nettles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus285.png" width="400" height="479" alt="Goat on the back of a donkey" />
</div>

<p>But what pleasure can one find in dainty fare when one is
alone? Jack stood looking around till he happened to spy a
goat who seemed to be about as sad as himself.</p>

<p>"Are you homesick?" asked Jack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said the goat mournfully.</p>

<p>"Some other kind of sick?" suggested Jack, glad to find
some one who would give him a civil answer.</p>

<p>"No," answered the goat; "but my mouth waters to taste
those little tender twigs on that tree just out of my reach.
If I only had a box," he added, shaking his head, "or something
to stand on, I could get them easily."</p>

<p>"Jump up on my back, and eat as many as you want,"
said Jack, ever ready to do a favor.</p>

<p>The goat hesitated. "I am afraid I might hurt you," he
said.</p>

<p>"Nothing ever hurts me," responded Jack. "Jump up."
So the goat took courage, made a leap, and landed safely on
the donkey's back.</p>

<p>Jack stood there patiently while his new friend made a
dainty feast.</p>

<p>"Is it good?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Delicious! Oh, so nice! But"&mdash;and the goat broke
off in a frightened manner. "Don't you see?" he began
again after a moment. "There's the farmer looking at us.
Oh, dear me, what will he do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Jack. "Go on eating, and let him look
if he wants to."</p>

<p>"No, no! I had better get down," said the goat.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," the donkey insisted. "Stay there, and
eat as much as you want."</p>

<p>The goat was not willing to be thought a coward: so, with
one eye still on the farmer, he began to eat again. His
master, after staring at the strange couple for a moment,
burst into a loud laugh, and went away.</p>

<p>"There, I've had enough," the goat said with a sigh of
pleasure, as he jumped off Jack's back. "Thank you very
much. Let's be friends."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack was so delighted with this suggestion, that he brayed
until the hills re-echoed with the sound of his voice. And
from that day to this the donkey and goat have been
inseparable friends. We never see one without the other.</p>

<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, but she is such a dear little mite!<br />
Never at rest: even now, as I write,<br />
Going out shopping, or making a call,<br />
Talking to chairs, rocking dolly so small.<br />
Never a leaf on the sunshiny tree,<br />
When the wind blows, is as tireless as she.<br />
Ask for a kiss, she will quietly say,<br />
"Haven't got time: I'm too busy to-day."<br />
</div>



<div class='poem'>
Are the birds weary when down goes the sun?<br />
Or the wee lambkins when homeward they run?<br />
Or the bright butterflies folding their wings?<br />
Grasshoppers, crickets, and all merry things?<br />
Then must this dear busybody of ours<br />
Long for her rest with the close of the flowers.<br />
Oh the sweet lips that so lovingly say,<br />
"Good-night,&mdash;so tired,&mdash;I've been busy to-day!"<br />

1. Once I got into a boat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Such a pretty, pretty boat!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Just as the day was dawning;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I took a little oar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And push'd off from the shore.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Oh, very, very early in the morning!</span><br />
<br />
Chorus.<br />
<br />
And every little wave had its nightcap on,<br />
Its nightcap, white cap, nightcap on;<br />
And every little wave had its nightcap on,<br />
So very, very early in the morning.<br />
<br />
2 In their caves so still and deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the fishes were asleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When a ripple gave them warning.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the minnow to the skate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Don't lie abed so late;"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said he, "'Tis very early in the morning."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Cho.</span>&mdash;For every little wave had its nightcap on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Its nightcap, white cap, nightcap on;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For every little wave had its nightcap on,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So very, very early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
3 Said the sturgeon to the eel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Just imagine how I feel;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(Excuse me, my dear, for yawning;)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">People ought to let us know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When sailing they would go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So very, very early in the morning."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cho.</span></span><br />

<h3>Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired.</p>

<p>The original text for the July issue had a table of contents that
spanned six issues. This was divided amongst those issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, only the July issue had a title page. This page was
copied for the remaining five issues. Each issue had the number added on
the title page after the Volume number.</p>

<p>Page 279, actual translation of "Dix centimes seulement" is "only ten cents" not "two" as
the original states.</p></div>
